The magnitude of the speed of the vertical motion of the ball is fixed to ballspeed.
The magnitude of the speed of the horizontal motion of the ball changes based where the ball hits the paddle.

The farther the ball hits from the middle of the paddle, the faster it will bounce back. Use this feature to change the
angle and direction of the ball.
